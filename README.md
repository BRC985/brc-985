# brc-985

BRC-985 is an experimental standard and there is no guarantee that tokens created using this standard will have any value or utility. If you decide to test , please read this document carefully and use it at your own risk.

BRC-985 is a token standard on the BTC native chain, issued by the MEMO decentralized storage team, to reduce the cost of issuing NFTs on the BTC network. The BRC-985 is designed to store NFT content in the Data Access system rather than on-chain, and to ensure data accessibility by providing the proof of data access, , which significantly reduces the cost of storage while ensuring that the data exists.

## Concept of BRC-985

BRC985 also provides three standards for issuing tokens for the Bitcoin network.

1. **brc-985-token**: brc-985-token is a fungible token standard. Fungible tokens can be deployed, minted, and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. **brc-985-da**: brc-985-da is a data access standard. Data will be stored on the off-chain provider, but proof of data availability will be provided to the on-chain under brc-985-da.
3. **brc-985-nft**: brc-985-nft is a non-fungible token standard. Non-fungible tokens can be deployed, minted, and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each token created under brc-985-nft has a unique identifier, making them distinct and non-interchangeable.
