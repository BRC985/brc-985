1. Check the inscription's value according to the following rules:

   - Check if the protocol name is `brc-985-da`;

   - Checks if the DA represented by `tick` exists in the DA list; if it does, then the deploy inscription is invalid;

   - Check if the token represented by `token` exists in the token list; if it does not, then the deploy inscription is invalid;

2. If the above checks pass, then the mint inscription is valid;

3. Use the hash value of `p` and `tick` as the default receiving address for the DA.

4. Update the DA list, add the basic information of the DA to the DA list.

## upload

```json
{
    "p": "brc-985-da",
    "op": "upload",
    "tick": "mooda",
    "id": "",
    "signature": ""
}
```

| key       | Required | Description                                          |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| p         | yes      | Protocol name                                        |
| op        | yes      | Operation                                            |
| tick      | yes      | Ticker                                               |
| id        | yes      | Data commitment                                      |
| signature | yes      | The Creator of the uploaded inscription signs the id |

**Note 1: In addition to uploading data to the DA, the Creator of the upload inscription also needs to pay `price` to the default receiving address.**

**Note 2: When the Indexer synchronizes the first Upload inscription information, set the creation time of the inscription as the start time `start`.**

1. Check the inscription's value according to the following rules:

   - Check if the protocol name is `brc-985-da`;

   - Checks if the DA represented by `tick` exists in the DA list; if it does not, then the upload inscription is invalid;

   - Check if the available balance of the Creator of the upload inscription is sufficient; if the available balance is not enough to pay `price`, then the upload inscription is invalid;

   - Check the format of the data commitment id;

   - Verify the signature, the signature method is as follows:

   - Original message: sort the id in dictionary order and concatenate in the form of key=value. For example: id=xxx.

   - The original message is hashed twice using SHA256 to generate the message digest `h`

   - `signature` is generated by signing the message digest `h` with the private key of Creator using the ECDSA secp256k1 algorithm, and encoded in base64.

2. If the above checks pass, then the upload inscription is valid;
3. Update the available balance of the Creator of the upload inscription, sub `price`;
4. Update the available balance of the default receiving address, add `price`;
5. Update the DA list, add the basic information of the DA to the DA list.

## epoch

```json
{
    "p": "brc-985-da",
    "op": "epoch",
    "tick": "mooda"
}
```

**Note 1：Whenever a new challenge period begins, the Epoch operation must be performed first, and then the Prove operation can be carried out. The core purpose of the Epoch operation is to establish the state of the challenge period, clarify which data will be involved in the proof generation process, and determine the verifiable random number.**

**Note 2: The Epoch operation will additionally check whether there is any unsubmitted situation in the previous period. If there is, the profit will be transferred to the `foundation`.**

1. Check the inscription's value according to the following rules:

   - Check if the protocol name is `brc-985-da`;

   - Checks if the DA represented by `tick` exists in the DA list; if it does not, then the upload inscription is invalid;

   - Check if the creation time of the inscription is greater than `start`; if it is greater, then pass; if it is not greater, then continue to check whether the current state is unsubmitted; if it is unsubmitted, then the Epoch inscription is invalid.

2. If the above checks pass, then the epoch inscription is valid;

3. Calculate the profit of the foundation address according to the following rules:

   - Use the creation time of the inscription as the current time;

   - Calculate the number of intervals and the interval time between the current time and `start`; for example, when the start time is 1000, the period is 200, and the current time is 1523, then the number of intervals is (1523-1000)/200=2, and the interval time is 2 * 200=400;

   - Calculate the profit based on the number of intervals and the balance of the default receiving address; for example, if the interval is 2 and the balance of the default receiving address is 100memo, then the profit is 100 * 1% * 2=2memo.

   - Update the available balance of `foundation`, add the profit value; 

   - Update the available balance of the default receiving address, subtract  the profit value;

   - Update `start`, add the interval time `interval`.

4. Specify that all data specified in the data commitment list will participate in the subsequent proof generation process;

5. Specify that the hash value of the creation time of the inscription and the last random number is the latest verifiable random number;

6. Set the state of the DA to unsubmitted.

## prove

```json
{
    "p": "brc-985-da",
    "op": "prove",
    "tick": "mooda",
    "proof": ""
}
```

| key   | Required | Description       |
| ----- | -------- | ----------------- |
| p     | yes      | Protocol name     |
| op    | yes      | Operation         |
| tick  | yes      | Ticker            |
| proof | yes      | data access proof |

**Note：In addition to proving the availability of all data, the "storage" should also receive profit from the default receiving address.**

1. Check the inscription's value according to the following rules:

   - Check if the protocol name is `brc-985-da`;

   - Checks if the DA represented by `tick` exists in the DA list; if it does not, then the upload inscription is invalid;

   - Check if the current cycle has already uploaded proof; if proof has been uploaded, then the proof inscription is invalid;

   - Check if the Creator of the prove inscription is consistent with `storage`; if not, then the prove inscription is invalid;

   - Verify the correctness of the data access proof;

2. If the above checks pass, then the mint inscription is valid;

3. Update the available balance of `storage`, add 1% of the default receiving address's available balance;

4. Update the available balance of the default receiving address, subtract 1% of the default receiving address's available balance;

5. Update `start`, add `interval`;

6. Change the state of the DA to submitted.
